COnditional Inference after LIkelihood-Based Selection

The package contains functions to calculate limits and conduct inference in a selective manner for linear models after likelihood- or test-based model selection. 

Please see https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09796 for more details.

Future improvements:
  - Testing grouped baselearners
  - Correct for plugin error variance approach
